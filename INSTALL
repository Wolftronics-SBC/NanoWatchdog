 NanoWatchdog - INSTALL

 The NanoWatchdog project spreads between an Arduino Nano and the PC
 host, and the project includes these two components.

 Installing PC part
 ==================

 As most of open-source projects, this one makes use of the GNU autoconf
 build system.

 From the source tree:

 $ autoreconf -f -i
 $ mkdir _build
 $ cd _build
 $ ../configure && make && make install

 or:
 $ ../configure && make && make DESTDIR=$(pwd/../_install) install

 Installing Arduino part
 =======================

 Open the Arduino/NanoWatchdog/NanoWatchdog.ino from your favorite
 Arduino IDE.
 Compile and upload.

 That's all, folks!
